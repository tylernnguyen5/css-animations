# Learning CSS Grid

I have been using the *12-column grid system* for awhile with some of the popular frameworks such as **Bootstrap** and **MaterializeCSS**, but have never really build the system with **CSS Grid** from scratch. This is an excercise so that I can learn more about **CSS Grid**, which I believe can help me implementing sophisticated layout designs or assist me in solving layout problems in CSS.

Beside CSS Grid, through this excercise I also learned to build a custom 12-column grid system and a custom Mosaic layout with Grid Areas and Responsive Grid.
